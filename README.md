# Anomaly-detection

**Description**: This project addresses classifying abnormal data registered from different patients. Considering six features regarding each patient's incidence, tilt, angle, slope, radius, and grade, we must classify the samples as normal and abnormal. The anomalous samples correspond to patients with different medical problems (e.g., disk hernia, spondylolisthesis).

**Task**: Create a model that accurately detects these anomalies, using Machine Learning methods.

**Method used**: Decision Tree.
